#this page ticks as all entities 20 times per second

#example

#say test
#will actually execute as all entities, so every entity on the
#server will do a say test, even tho only one command was
#ran, this will lag A LOT, since one command in here is equal
#to however many thousands of entities are loaded on the server


#one laggy command here is worth like tens of thousands of non
#laggy commands in main
